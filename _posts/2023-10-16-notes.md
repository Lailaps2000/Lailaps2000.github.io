Slogan: Turn topology problems into (purely) algebraic problems.

Some notes after the discussion with my advisor:
* Motivic Adams spectral sequence is important.
* For GWX, understanding the Milnor square is the most important thing. Instead, introducing every category that appeared in that paper is unnecessary. This paper still stands without the $\infty$-category part.
* Focus on the relations between those spectral sequences, and figure out how information of homotopy flows in them.
* Ask Prof. Wang for some pieces of advice about the outline. His suggestions about which parts are important are very instructive.
* Refer to the overview articles of GWX (ICM2022) and BKWX (ICBS2023). Ask Prof. Wang for these articles.
* Try to translate category language into some explicit calculation that may be helpful to our understanding.
* The estimated time is not meaningful, but it partly shows the amount of knowledge we need to introduce at that part.
* Talk with LTT with the following part. Build a working group with FDU and UCSD is a good choice.

Part 1: t-structures (Introduction)
======
* Remember to talk that with ZSH about the cooperation. Better to finish this part in Day1.
* Slogan: t-structures help us construct Adams-liks spectral sequence in $\infty$-categories.
* Brief introduction of applications of t-structures. (HA 1.2) (About 5 minutes)
* The definition of t-structures, filtered objects and the correspondence spectral sequences. (HA 1.2) (About 20 minutes)
  * Compare it with the classical Adams spectral sequences (in the proof part)
  * Explain the definition by showing the geometric meaning of these definitions in $Sp$ as examples.
* (Optional) $\infty$=category-version of Dold-Kan correspondence.

Part 2: Chow t-structures.
======
* Slogan: Chow t-structures help us construct motivic Adams-liks spectral sequences in many more situations.
* Brief introduction of motivic Adams spectral sequences. (The motivic Adams spectral sequence, Daniel Dugger and Daniel C. Isaksen.) (About 20 minutes, or longer)
  * Compare it with Adams spectral sequences. (what structures we enrich, some differences in calculation)
    * (Optional) Some easy calculations as examples.
  * Clarify what have we known and what we haven't about motivic Adams spectral sequences
  * Its relation with algebraic Novikov spectral sequence. (Or talk about it later?)
  * (Problem) What will happen in real motivic homotopy? (The influence of tri-graded spheres.)
* The definition of Chow t-structures. (About 20 minutes)
  * Compare with ordinary t-structures.
  * Show why does it have such benefits on:
    * Valid over stable motivic homotopy category than just the p-completed sphere spectrum.
    * Valid for the integral case.
    * Valid for other base field than just $\mathbb{C}$
  * (Problem) I'm not sure what we enrich on the Chow t-structure.

Part 3: The theoretical results of GWX.
======
* Slogan: show how the information flows in those categories.
* Brief introduction of those categories we need. (About 20 minutes) (Just follow the order of GWX)
  * We can spend less time on this?
* Show how the information flows in those categories. (About 20 minutes) (With diagrams)
* (Problem) I can't write a better version of the introduction of GWX, but just read the introduction of GWX is not so good.
* (Same problem for BKWX. We can talk about some details but I'm afraid that the time isn't enough.)
