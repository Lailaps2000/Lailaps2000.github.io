Slogan: Turn topology problems into (purely) algebraic problems.

Part 1: t-structures (induction)
======
* Slogan: t-strucures help us construct Adams-liks spectral sequence in $\infty$-categories.
* Brief introduction of applications of t-structures. (HA 1.2) (About 5 minutes)
* The definition of t-structures, filtered objects and the correspondence spectral sequences. (HA 1.2) (About 20 minutes)
  * Compare it with the classical Adams spectral sequences (in the proof part)
  * Explain the definition by showing the geometric meaning of these definition in $Sp$ as examples.
* (Optional) $\infty$=category-version of Dold-Kan correspondence.

Part 2: Chow-t-structures.
======
* Slogan: Chow t-structures help us construct motivic Adams-liks spectral sequences on much more situation.
* Brief introduction of motivic Adams spectral sequences. (The motivic Adams spectral sequence, Daniel Dugger and Daniel C. Isaksen.) (About 20 minutes, or longer)
  * Compare it with Adams spectral sequences. (what structures we enrich, some differences in calculation)
    * (Optional) Some easy calcualtion as examples.
  * Clearify what have we known and what we haven't about motivic Adams spectral sequences
  * Its relation with algebraic Novikov spectral sequence. (Or talk about it latter?)
  * (Problem) What will happened in real motivic homotopy? (The influence of tri-graded spheres.)
* The defintion of Chow-t-structures. (About 20 minutes)
  * Compare with ordinary t-structures.
  * Show why does it have such benefits on:
    * Valid over stable motivic homotopy category than just the p-completed sphere spectrum.
    * Valid for the integral case.
    * Valid for other base field than just $\mathbb{C}$
  * (Problem) I'm not sure what we enrich on the Chow-t-structure.

Part 3: The theoretical results of GWX.
======
* Slogan: show how does the information flow in those categories.
* Brief introduction of those categories we need. (About 20 minutes) (Just follow the order of GWX)
* Show how does the information flow in those categories. (About 20 minutes) (With diagrams)
* (Problem) I can't write a better version of introduction of GWX, but just read the introduction of GWX is not so good?
* (Same problem for BKWX. We can talk about some details but I'm afraid that the time isn't enough.)

Should I swtich Part 2 and Part 3?
