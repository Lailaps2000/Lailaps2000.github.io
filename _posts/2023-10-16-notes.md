Slogan: Turn topology problems into (purely) algebraic problems.

Part 1: t-structures (induction)
======
* Slogan: t-strucures help us construct Adams-liks spectral sequence in $\infty$-categories.
* Brief introduction of applications of t-structures. (HA 1.2) (About 5 minutes)
* The definition of t-structures, filtered objects and the correspondence spectral sequences. (HA 1.2) (About 20 minutes)
  * Compare it with the classical Adams spectral sequences (in the proof part)
  * Explain the definition by showing the geometric meaning of these definition in $Sp$ as examples.
* (Optional) $\infty$=category-version of Dold-Kan correspondence.

Part 2: Chow-t-structures
======
* Slogan: Chow t-structures help us construct motivic Adams-liks spectral sequences.
* Brief introduction of motivic Adams spectral sequences. (About 15 minutes, or longer)
  * Compare it with Adams spectral sequences. (what structures we enrich, some differences in calculation)
    * (Optional) Some easy calcualtion as examples.
  * Clearify what have we known and what we haven't about motivic Adams spectral sequences
  * Its relation with algebraic Novikov spectral sequence. (Or talk about it latter?)
  * (Problem) What will happened in real motivic homotopy? (The influence of tri-graded spheres)
* The defintion of Chow-t-structures. (About 15 minutes)
  * Compare with the
