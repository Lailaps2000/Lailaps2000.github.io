In this talk we give a brief introduction into the history of the computation of (stable) homotopy groups of spheres. Starting with a review of the Serre spectral sequence, the Eilenberg-Maclean space and the anicent way of computing higher homotopy groups with these tools, we introduce the motivation and the idea behind the construction of the classical Adams spectral sequence as well as its proof. The main reference of this talk is chapter 6 of Homotopical Topology by Fuchs and Fomenko.
